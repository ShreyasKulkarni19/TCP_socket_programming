# TCP_socket_programming

1. This project is on a distributed password cracker. This uses TCP socket programming. Here we have 2 clients to decode the password generated by the server.
2. The server greates a random alphanumeric password of length 4. This is encrypted using hashing technique. 
3. The two clients get the encrypted password.
4. The total number of possiblities of the password are then shared by the two clients. The first half is taken by client 1, and the other half by client 2.
5. For each password, the clients encrypt and check for match between the original password and the client generated password.
6. If C1/C2 finds the password, then we get the output telling that client1 / client2 has found the password. It displays the password below.
